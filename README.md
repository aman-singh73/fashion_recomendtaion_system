Fashion Recommendation System
Overview
The Fashion Recommendation System is a machine learning-based web application designed to recommend similar fashion images based on a user's uploaded image. It uses a combination of feature extraction, nearest neighbors, and image captioning to provide relevant recommendations.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload their fashion images for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Extracts features from the uploaded image using a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
Nearest Neighbors Search: Finds similar images from a pre-defined dataset using the nearest neighbors algorithm.
Image Captioning: Generates descriptive captions for recommended images using the BLIP model.
Visual Recommendations: Displays recommended images along with their captions on a web interface.
